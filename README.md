# **Employee Data Analyzer System (Java)**

The **Employee Data Analyzer System** is a Java-based application designed to efficiently manage, process, and analyze employee data. It provides a structured way to store employee details—such as names, departments, and salaries—and perform useful operations like searching, filtering, and statistical analysis.

This project is ideal for practicing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, **data manipulation**, **exception handling**, and **multithreading**, making it a great educational or starter project.
